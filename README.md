# trigger-exam

As much as most institutions of learning have embraced E-learning to raise the bar and so as to cope with the ever growing number of learners , very few institutions have adopted an online examination system, in fact little has been done in the development of online systems. Lot of resources (time and money) are wasted since students have to move from place to place to do exams. Time and manpower is also wasted as setting and marking of the exams is done manually.

●	The purpose of the online exam system is to take online tests in an efficient manner 
●	The main objective of the online exam tool is to efficiently evaluate the candidate thoroughly through a fully automated system that not only saves a lot of time but also gives fast results.
●	It's scalable – supports ‘n’ number of users.
●	It is user friendly and it is anticipated that functions of the system will be easily accessed by admin, faculties and students.
Develop an attractive examination portal in which users can create an account with different roles (Admin, student & staff). The system will allow the users  to perform tasks according to the role.
